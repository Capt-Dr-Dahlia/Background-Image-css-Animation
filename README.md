# A simple CSS animation

An example of using CSS keyframes for animation.

This one was a little confusing, coulndn't quite understand the values. Also i need to practice or research how to properly change pictures without messing the whole thing up. Code feels like a jenga tower, and i'm to scarerd to change things for fear of knowcking it all down.
